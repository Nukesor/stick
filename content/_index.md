Most of my career was about working on web development projects, their associated infrastructure, and the team's DevOps setup.
I worked with lots of different technologies, stacks, infrastructure paradigms, and weird development setups.

In 2021 I decided to become a Freelance Consultant, as a few possibilities opened up, and so far it has been a blast!

My current focus is on systems programming, web development (back-end, SysOps, DevOps, a bit of front-end now and then), and software architecture.

As for programming languages I prefer Rust, but I'm comfortable with Typescript, modern Python and PHP, and Lua.
I professionally worked on multiple projects with Rust since 2021 in the scope of high-performance web servers, embedded software engineering and systems programming.

When I'm not working, I develop and maintain a few open-source projects such as command-line tools, libraries, and chatbots.
Some of them even became quite popular. A list of the most prominent projects can be found at the <a href="#personal-projects">bottom of this page</a>.

<h2>Interests</h2>

I have a lot of fun using and building good tooling.
There's something incredibly satisfying in optimizing some processes and seeing your projects being used by other people.

This is probably one of the main reasons why I ended up in the open-source community.
People share their ideas and projects, while they continue to improve each other's projects!

I'm very interested in new technologies!
For one, I'm fascinated by Rust and its rapidly developing and stabilizing ecosystem.
As stated above, I currently have the pleasure to work with a Rust stack in a professional environment and I'll continue to do so if I can!

Well, I think that's enough introduction for now.
